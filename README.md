# HAI: Human AI
*A Constitutional Framework for Human-Centered AI Development*

---

## Introduction

We stand at a crossroads. AI can either diminish humanity through dependency or elevate humanity through enhancement.

HAI is a framework built on one core principle: AI should amplify human intelligence, never substitute it.

This framework is evolutive - open to anyone who wants to contribute to the evolution of the human species. This evolution will result through collective collaboration, with each contribution expanding our understanding of how AI can serve human development.

These statements and questions provide the foundation for human-centered AI development - abstract enough to generate infinite applications, specific enough to guide meaningful choices.

**The future of human-AI interaction depends on the principles we establish today.**

**Contribute to humanity's evolution - don't surrender it.**

## Objectives

**Maximize Human Development and Evolution**: Leverage AI to accelerate gains in technical, theoretical, and intellectual skills, fostering human innovation at an exponential rate. 

**Prevent Dependency and Centralization**: Avoid futures where AI becomes civilization's crutch, preserving human agency.

**Promote Correct Understanding and Pluralistic Tracks**
