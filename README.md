# HAI: Human AI
*A Constitutional Framework for Human-Centered AI Development*

---

## Introduction

We stand at a crossroads. AI can either diminish humanity through dependency or elevate humanity through enhancement.

HAI is a framework built on one core principle: AI should amplify human intelligence, never substitute it.

These statements and questions provide the foundation for human-centered AI development - abstract enough to generate infinite applications, specific enough to guide meaningful choices.

This is evolutive. Add your interpretations. Build your tools. Ask your questions.

**The future of human-AI interaction depends on the principles we establish today.**
